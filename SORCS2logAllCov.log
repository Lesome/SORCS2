4 (of 4) markers to be included from [ SORCS2.map ]
Reading pedigree information from [ SORCS2.fam ] 
7727 individuals read from [ SORCS2.fam ] 
7727 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
3567 cases, 4160 controls and 0 missing
3193 males, 4534 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading 9 covariates from [ SORCS2cov.txt ] with nonmissing values for 7727 individuals
Selected subset of 8 from 9 covariates
For these, nonmissing covariate values for 7727 individuals
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
7727 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.95891
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
After filtering, 3567 cases, 4160 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 3193 males, 4534 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing logistic model association results to [ SORCS2logAllCov.assoc.logistic ]
